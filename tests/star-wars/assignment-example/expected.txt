*** A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.  ***

CREATURE: Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

*** The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore ***
*** the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby  ***
*** Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the       ***
*** belligerent monstrosity.                                   ***

HUMAN: He doesn't like you.

LUKE: I'm sorry.

HUMAN: I don't like you either.

*** The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some    ***
*** unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young  ***
*** adventurer.                                                ***

HUMAN: Don't insult us.
You just watch yourself. 
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence in twelve systems.

LUKE: I'll be careful then.

HUMAN: You'll be dead!
